This program consists of three separate earthquake animations,
each one displaying what happens during an earthquake of one of
three magnitudes (3.0, 6.0, or 9.5). The user can click on any 
of the buttons on the home screen to be directed to an 
animation of an earthquake of the selected magnitude.
